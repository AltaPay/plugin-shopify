> * Make sure that the browser cookies are enabled.

## App Types

AltaPay offers two types of apps for Shopify payments. The first one shows a single payment option with the title "AltaPay - Multiple Payment Options" on the Shopify checkout page and the customer will see all the available options on the next page.

The second one is a separate app for each payment method individually shown on the Shopify checkout page. 
Once a customer selects that, he will be redirected to the respective payment method. This also reduces one step as compared to the above app type and increases the conversion rate as well.

Below are sections that include the sample screenshots of each app type.

**If test mode is enabled, all transactions, including those made using the Production tab, will go to the test gateway. No actual financial transactions will take place.**

5. Make sure that you are working in the correct tab.
6. Enter the username and password AltaPay has given to you.

    ![shopify_gateway_config](/Docs/configuration/shopify_gateway_config.jpg)

8. Save the details.
9. Next, you need to configure the payment methods (terminals). See [Configuring the Payment Methods](#configuring-the-payment-methods) for more details.

### Configuring the Payment Methods

> **Prerequisites**
> 
> To log in, you will need:
>

    >- **Test** for configuring a test account which can be used to test the gateway. No actual financial transactions will be made via this account.
    >- **Production** for configuring the production account, i.e. the account which will enable actual financial transactions. **If test mode is enabled in the AltaPay Omni gateway, all transactions, including those done in the Production tab, will go to the test gateway and no actual transactions will take place.**

    <br>

3. Make sure that you are working in the correct tab.
4. You will see a list of payment methods configured by AltaPay according to the agreement you have made with us. 

    > **Note**
    > 
    > * If you are configuring the payment method for individual app, you will see detail page instead of payment methods list. 
    > * Skip point 5 and 6 for individual app.

    <br>
  
    ![shopify_config_pm_1](/Docs/configuration/shopify_config_pm_1.png)

    The default names of the payment methods come from the title the payment method has been given by AltaPay.

5. Click on a given terminal/payment method to change the configuration.
6. The payment method details are displayed. Configure the details as required, using the notes and illustration for guidance.

    ![config_terminals](/Docs/configuration/config_terminals.jpg)

>- Complete the details:

<table>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Payment method name as displayed to customer</strong></td>
    <td>Key in the name you want show on the screen</td>

    <td>The payment method <strong>secret</strong>. If it is decided as part of the onboarding process that this parameter is relevant for you, it will be provided by AltaPay.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Display priority</strong></td>
    <td>Enter a value to indicate the order in which you want payment methods to be displayed on the page, where the customer selects their preferred payment method. 1 is the highest priority. If you give the same display priority to more than one payment methods, they will be shown in alphabetical order.
</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</tbody>

- Specify whether **order lines** will be shown in the payment form.

>**Note**
>
> Order lines are required for Klarna payments. So you have to enable the "Order lines" option for Klarna in Terminal settings. This will automatically add a single line item with **Total** amount as Shopify does not share actual line items with any third-party payment provider.
>
> To enable the order lines, click on a Klarna terminal and scroll to the "Order lines" section, and click on the "Enable" button.

- Select whether the **payment method is active** - this decides whether the customer can select this payment method to complete the transaction.
- Choose from the predefined **icons** to display to the customer for a given payment method. You can select a single icon from the left hand column. If the payment method is **Credit Card**, you can select multiple icons. These will be shown in the **Select Payment Method** page, and the **Payment Form** page.

7. Click on <strong>Save </strong>to save the details.
